Symbolic links, otherwise known as symlinks, are basically advanced shortcuts. 
You can create symbolic links to individual files or folders, and then these 
will appear like they are stored in the folder with the symbolic link even 
though the symbolic link only points to their real location.

To easily update views even though we are compiling them:
	Open Windows Explorer
	Create a folder for the Area you want (i.e. Areas) in the target root dir (MvcBootstrap\Run00.MvcBootstrap.TestHost)
	Expose the tree view and find the source folder you want and the target
		i.e. Source - MvcBootstrap\Run00.MvcBootstrap\Views
		i.e. Target - MvcBootstrap\Run00.MvcBootstrap.TestHost\Areas
	Right click on the source folder and select "Pick Link Source"
	Right click on the target folder and select "Drop As..." > "Symbolic Link"

	Without re-compiling, change the source folder, save, and refresh.
	ENJOY!
